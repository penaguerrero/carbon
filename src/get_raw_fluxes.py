'''
This code finds the net fluxes (or raw intensities) and equivalent widths from the redshift-corrected spectra of the given object.
It writes a text file containing the line information it found for that wavelength range.
    * The possible lines the code looks for are all those in the line_catalog.txt file in the spectrum folder

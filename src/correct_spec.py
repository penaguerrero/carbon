'''
This script creates the text files of wavelength and flux in case there are some corrections to make by hand to the spectra.
        * these text files can later be runned by the task rspectext in order to create a fits file that splot can read
        AFTER RUNNING THIS SCRIPT:
        1. in splot correct the fits file
        2. reconvert the corrected fits file to text with wspectext
